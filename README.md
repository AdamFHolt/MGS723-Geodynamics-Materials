The class materials for MGS 723 (Geodynamics), as taught in Spring 2021 at the University of Miami. Many sources were used (and hopefully referenced) to create this class but, below, I give three sources that **heavily** influenced the class:

- Turcotte D. L. and G. Schubert, Geodynamics, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2nd edition.
- Becker T. W. and B. Kaus, Numerical Modeling of Earth Systems, Online notes: http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/Geodynamics557.pdf
- Becker T. W. and C. Faccenna, Tectonic Geodynamics, Online Textbook Draft: http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/preprints/tectonic_geodynamics_draft.pdf
